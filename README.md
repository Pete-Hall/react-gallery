## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).


- [x] Use axios to retrieve (GET) data from to /gallery and store it in App.jsx.
- [x] create _taco component for template
- [x] create GalleryList component and map over the list of gallery data
- [ ] in GalleryItem...
  [x] display the image
  [x] swap the image with description on click
  [x] display number of likes for each moment and include a like button
  [ ] on like button click, use axios to make a put call update the like count (this goes in the GalleryItem component?)
  [ ] update gallery each time a like button is clicked



  [ ] add better css styling to image/description swap (same sizes!) - this is tough since images are being sized responsively. maybe flex boxes. maybe material UI
